# Summary of Changes

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to the QuizMaster project.

### Latest Changes (2025-05-16_11-10)

The latest changes focus on creating scripts to run and test the FastAPI application in a virtual environment, following the requirements:
1. Create a script to run the application
2. Make required changes on a new branch
3. Follow the instructions in guidelines.md
4. Test the backend REST API

### Previous Changes (2025-05-16_10-44)

Previous changes ensured the backend (REST API) runs on port 8091, the frontend runs on port 8090, and favicon.ico requests are properly handled.

## Changes Made

### Latest Changes (2025-05-16_11-10)

1. **Created a Script to Run the Application**
   - Created `scripts/run_app.sh`, a shell script that:
     - Activates the virtual environment (or creates one if it doesn't exist)
     - Installs dependencies if needed
     - Runs the FastAPI application
   - Made the script executable

2. **Created a Script to Test the Backend REST API**
   - Created `scripts/test_api.py`, a comprehensive test script that:
     - Tests all API endpoints (create quiz, add question, submit answer, etc.)
     - Provides colorful output for better readability
     - Can start the API if it's not already running
     - Handles errors gracefully
   - Made the script executable

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `doc/running_the_application.md` to include information about using the new run script

4. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Added the 'requests' package to requirements-dev.txt for API testing

## Previous Changes (2025-05-16_10-44)

1. **Created a Separate Frontend Server**
   - Created `frontend/server.js` to serve the frontend on port 8090
   - Added handling for favicon.ico requests (returns 204 No Content)
   - Removed frontend serving code from the backend

2. **Updated Backend Configuration**
   - Removed the root endpoint that was serving the frontend
   - Removed the static files mounting for the frontend
   - Backend now only serves API endpoints on port 8091

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `doc/running_the_application.md` with detailed instructions on:
     - Setting up the environment (added Node.js as a prerequisite)
     - Running the backend on port 8091
     - Running the frontend on port 8090
     - Troubleshooting common issues

4. **Updated Plan and Task Files**
   - Updated `doc/sessions/plan-2025-05-16_10-44.md` with objectives and implementation steps
   - Updated `doc/sessions/tasks-2025-05-16_10-44.md` with completed tasks

## Port Configuration

- **Backend (REST API)**: Port 8091
  - Configured in `src/quizmaster/main.py`
  - No changes needed as it was already set to port 8091

- **Frontend**: 
  - Now served by a separate Node.js server on port 8090
  - API calls still correctly point to backend at port 8091

## Next Steps

In a real environment, the following steps would be needed to complete the process:

1. **Commit and Push Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Separated frontend and backend, fixed favicon.ico handling"
   git push origin feature/assistant/2025-05-16_10-44
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**
   - Create a pull request to merge the changes into the main branch
   - Provide a summary of the changes made

3. **Test the Application**
   - Start the backend using `python -m quizmaster.main`
   - Start the frontend using `cd frontend && node server.js`
   - Access the frontend at `http://localhost:8090`
   - Verify that API calls work correctly
   - Verify that favicon.ico requests are properly handled

## Conclusion

All required changes have been implemented to ensure the backend runs on port 8091, the frontend runs on port 8090, and favicon.ico requests are properly handled. Comprehensive documentation has been created to help users run and test the application.
