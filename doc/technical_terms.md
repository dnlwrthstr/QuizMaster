# Technical Terms in Web Development

Here's an explanation of each technical term you asked about:


## Full-Stack Web Application
A full-stack web application is a complete software solution that handles both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) components of a web application. Full-stack developers work on all aspects of the application, including:
- User interface (front-end)
- Server logic (back-end)
- Database operations
- API development and integration

## Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. Key characteristics include:
- Simple, readable syntax with significant whitespace
- Dynamic typing and automatic memory management
- Extensive standard library and third-party packages
- Support for multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, procedural)
- Popular for web development, data science, AI/ML, automation, and more

## FastAPI
FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. Notable features include:
- Built on Starlette for high performance with async support
- Automatic API documentation via OpenAPI and Swagger UI
- Type hints-based data validation using Pydantic
- Extremely fast execution (on par with NodeJS and Go)
- Intuitive design with minimal code duplication

## REST (Representational State Transfer)
REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful APIs follow these principles:
- Stateless client-server communication
- Uniform interface using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Resources identified by URLs
- Representation of resources (typically JSON or XML)
- Hypermedia links between related resources (HATEOAS)

## HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines:
- The structure and content of web pages
- Elements represented by tags (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`)
- Document hierarchy and semantic meaning
- Links to other resources (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
- Forms for user input

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of HTML documents:
- Controls layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and visual effects
- Allows separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)
- Supports responsive design for different screen sizes
- Enables animations and transitions
- Uses selectors to target specific HTML elements

## JS (JavaScript)
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for client-side web development:
- Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages
- Can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Supports event-driven programming
- Now also used for server-side development (Node.js)
- Enables asynchronous operations with Promises and async/await
- Powers modern web frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue
