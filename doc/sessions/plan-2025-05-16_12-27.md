# Development Plan - 2025-05-16_12-27

## Objectives
- Fix the issue where the placeholder text "Question text will appear here." is being displayed instead of the actual question text in the QuizMaster application.
- Ensure that the question text is properly displayed when a quiz is being taken.

## Implementation Steps
1. Examine the frontend code (index.html and script.js) to understand the issue.
2. Investigate the data flow from backend to frontend for questions.
3. Identify the root cause of the issue:
   - In index.html, there's a placeholder text: `<h3 id="question-text">Question text will appear here.</h3>`
   - In script.js, the showQuestion function is supposed to update this element with the actual question text.
   - The backend correctly transforms the question text from "question" to "text" in the QuestionModel.
4. Fix the issue in the frontend code by ensuring that the question text is properly accessed and displayed.
5. Test the application to ensure questions display correctly.
