# Summary of Detail Screen Bug Fix

## Issue Description
The question text was not being displayed on the detail screen. The JSON returned by the backend includes the question text in the 'text' property, but it was not being properly displayed in the UI.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a mismatch between the HTML element ID and the JavaScript code. The HTML file had a commented out element with ID 'question-text' and a new element with ID 'display-question-text', but the JavaScript code was trying to update the element with ID 'display-question-text'.

## Changes Made
1. Updated the HTML file to use a single element with ID 'question-text' instead of the commented out element and the element with ID 'display-question-text'.
2. Updated the script.js file to use the element with ID 'question-text' instead of 'display-question-text'.

## Files Changed
- frontend/index.html
- frontend/script.js

## Testing
The application was tested to verify that the question text is now properly displayed on the detail screen.

## Steps Taken
1. Created a new branch 'fix/detail-screen-question-text'
2. Examined the current implementation in script.js and index.html
3. Identified the issue with question text display
4. Fixed the issue in script.js to properly display question text from the API response
5. Tested the application to verify the fix works
6. Created documentation in doc/sessions directory
7. Committed changes to the fix branch
8. Merged the fix branch to the main branch

## Conclusion
The issue has been fixed by ensuring that the HTML element ID and the JavaScript code are consistent. The question text is now properly displayed on the detail screen.
