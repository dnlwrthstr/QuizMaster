# Summary of Changes - 2025-05-16_12-57

## Issue: "Question text will appear here" Displayed Instead of Real Question

### Problem Identification

The issue was that the placeholder text "Question text will appear here." was being displayed instead of the actual question text in the QuizMaster application. This was happening because the frontend code wasn't properly handling the question data structure.

### Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Error Handling in `showQuestion` Function**
   - Added checks to ensure the question object exists before accessing its properties
   - Added fallback text if the question text is not available

   ```javascript
   if (question && question.text) {
       document.getElementById('question-text').textContent = question.text;
   } else if (question && question.question) {
       document.getElementById('question-text').textContent = question.question;
   } else {
       console.error('Question text not found in question object:', question);
       document.getElementById('question-text').textContent = 'Error: Question text not available.';
   }
   ```

2. **Improved Answer Options Rendering**
   - Added checks to ensure the answers array exists and is an array
   - Added checks to ensure each answer is a valid object
   - Added fallback text if the answer text is not available

   ```javascript
   if (question && question.answers && Array.isArray(question.answers)) {
       question.answers.forEach((answer, i) => {
           if (answer && typeof answer === 'object') {
               const answerButton = document.createElement('button');
               answerButton.className = 'answer-option';
               answerButton.textContent = answer.text || 'Answer text not available';
               answerButton.setAttribute('data-index', i);
               answerButton.addEventListener('click', () => selectAnswer(i));
               answersList.appendChild(answerButton);
           }
       });
   } else {
       console.error('Question answers not found or not an array:', question);
   }
   ```

3. **Added Debug Logging**
   - Added console logging to help debug issues with question data
   - This will make it easier to identify problems in the future

   ```javascript
   // Log the question object to debug
   console.log('Question object:', question);
   ```

### Expected Results

These changes ensure that:
1. The actual question text is displayed instead of the placeholder text
2. The application doesn't crash if the question data structure is unexpected
3. Appropriate error messages are logged to the console for debugging
4. Fallback text is displayed if the question or answer text is not available

The changes add robust error handling to prevent the application from breaking when dealing with unexpected data structures, while still attempting to display the correct information when available.

### Testing

The fix was tested by:
1. Running the application and creating a new quiz
2. Adding questions with various data structures
3. Taking the quiz to verify that the question text is properly displayed
4. Checking the console for error messages when using invalid data

All tests confirmed that the fix works as expected and the placeholder text is no longer displayed when taking a quiz.
