# Fix Detail Screen Bug

## Issue Description
The question text was not being displayed on the detail screen. The JSON returned by the backend includes the question text in the 'text' property, but it was not being properly displayed in the UI.

## Changes Made
1. Updated the HTML file to use a single element with ID 'question-text' instead of the commented out element and the element with ID 'display-question-text'.
2. Updated the script.js file to use the element with ID 'question-text' instead of 'display-question-text'.

## Files Changed
- frontend/index.html
- frontend/script.js

## Testing
The application was tested to verify that the question text is now properly displayed on the detail screen.

## Steps Taken
1. Created a new branch 'fix/detail-screen-question-text'
2. Examined the current implementation in script.js and index.html
3. Identified the issue with question text display
4. Fixed the issue in script.js to properly display question text from the API response
5. Tested the application to verify the fix works
6. Created documentation in doc/sessions directory
7. Merged the fix branch to the main branch
