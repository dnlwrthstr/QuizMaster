# Plan to Fix "Question Text Will Appear Here" Issue

## Objective
Fix the issue where the placeholder text "Question text will appear here." is not being replaced with the actual question text when a quiz is being taken.

## Analysis
The issue is in the frontend code where the placeholder text in the HTML:
```html
<h3 id="question-text">Question text will appear here.</h3>
```
is not being properly updated with the actual question text when a quiz is being taken.

## Implementation Steps
1. Examine the `showQuestion()` function in `script.js` which is responsible for updating the question text
2. Add proper null/undefined checks before accessing question properties
3. Ensure the question text is correctly assigned to the DOM element
4. Add error handling to provide fallback text if the question data is invalid
5. Test the fix to ensure it works correctly

## Specific Changes Needed
In the `showQuestion()` function in `script.js`, we need to:

1. Add null/undefined checks before accessing `question.text` or `question.question`
2. Ensure proper error handling if the question object is invalid
3. Add appropriate console logging for debugging purposes

## Code Fix
```javascript
function showQuestion(index) {
    const question = quizQuestions[index];
    
    // Log the question object to debug
    console.log('Question object:', question);
    
    // Update question text with proper null checks
    if (question && question.text) {
        document.getElementById('question-text').textContent = question.text;
    } else if (question && question.question) {
        document.getElementById('question-text').textContent = question.question;
    } else {
        console.error('Question text not found in question object:', question);
        document.getElementById('question-text').textContent = 'Error: Question text not available.';
    }
    
    // Rest of the function with similar null checks...
}
```

This fix ensures that the code properly checks if the question object and its properties exist before trying to use them, preventing the placeholder text from remaining when it should be replaced with actual question text.
