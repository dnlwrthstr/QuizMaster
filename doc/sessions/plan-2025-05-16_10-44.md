# Development Plan - 2025-05-16_10-44

## Objectives
- Analyze the QuizMaster project structure and configuration
- Ensure the backend (REST API) runs on port 8091
- Ensure the frontend runs on port 8090
- Set up and run the FastAPI application in a virtual environment
- Fix any issues that arise during setup and execution

## Implementation Steps
1. Examine the project structure to understand the codebase
2. Check the current backend and frontend port configurations
   - Verify backend port in main.py (should be 8091)
   - Verify frontend API_BASE_URL in script.js (should point to backend port 8091)
3. Create a new branch following the guidelines
4. Update plan and task files for this session
5. Make necessary changes to ensure correct port configuration
6. Set up and activate the virtual environment
7. Install required dependencies from requirements.txt
8. Run the FastAPI application to verify it works
9. Fix any issues that arise
10. Document all changes and steps taken
11. Commit and push changes to the new branch

## Timeline
- Analysis and planning: 15 minutes
- Implementation of changes: 30 minutes
- Testing and verification: 15 minutes
