# Development Plan - 2025-05-15_13-54

## Objectives

- Create a Python chatbot that asks beginner-level programming questions
- Implement a single-choice question format with correct answer validation
- Develop a continuous interaction loop with the ability to quit
- Include 4-5 preset Python questions for users to answer
- Ensure code follows best practices and is well-documented

## Implementation Steps

1. **Design the Quiz Model**
   - Create a Quiz class to store questions, answers, and correct answers
   - Implement methods to add questions and validate answers
   - Add proper error handling for invalid inputs

   - Implement a method to display questions and accept user input
   - Add logic to validate user answers and provide feedback
   - Include functionality to quit the quiz at any point

3. **Create Default Python Questions**
   - Develop 4-5 beginner-level Python questions
   - Include questions about variables, comments, functions, data types, and operators
   - Ensure questions are clear and have unambiguous answers

4. **Implement Main Application Entry Point**
   - Create a main module to initialize and start the quiz bot
   - Ensure proper welcome messages and instructions are displayed

5. **Write Unit Tests**
   - Create tests for the Quiz model
