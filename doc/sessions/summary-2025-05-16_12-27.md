## Issue Description
The placeholder text "Question text will appear here." was being displayed instead of the actual question text in the QuizMaster application. This issue was occurring because the frontend code was trying to access the question text using `question.text`, but the property might be named differently in the question object.

## Investigation
1. Examined the frontend code (index.html and script.js) to understand the issue:
   - In index.html, there's a placeholder text: `<h3 id="question-text">Question text will appear here.</h3>`
   - In script.js, the showQuestion function is supposed to update this element with the actual question text using `document.getElementById('question-text').textContent = question.text;`

2. Investigated the data flow from backend to frontend for questions:
   - In quiz.py, the question text is stored as "question" not "text"
   - In main.py, the backend correctly transforms "question" to "text" in the QuestionModel
   - In script.js, the startQuiz function sets quizQuestions to quiz.questions
   - The fetchQuiz function returns the JSON response from the API

## Solution
Modified the showQuestion function in script.js to handle the case where question.text might be undefined:
1. Added debugging to log the question object to the console
2. Added a check for question.text, and if it exists, use it to update the question text
3. If question.text doesn't exist, check if question.question exists, and if so, use it instead
4. If neither exists, log an error and display a default error message

This solution ensures that the question text is properly displayed regardless of whether it's stored in the "text" or "question" property in the question object.

## Testing
The application should now display the actual question text instead of the placeholder text. The debugging logs will help identify the structure of the question object and ensure that the correct property is being used.
