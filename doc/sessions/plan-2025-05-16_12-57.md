# Development Plan - 2025-05-16_12-57

## Objectives
- Fix the issue where placeholder text "Question text will appear here." is displayed instead of the actual question text
- Ensure the application handles unexpected data structures gracefully
- Add appropriate error handling and fallback text
- Document the changes made

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a new branch following the guidelines
2. Examine the frontend code (index.html and script.js) to understand how questions are displayed
3. Investigate the data flow from backend to frontend to understand how question data is structured
4. Identify the root cause of the issue by examining the showQuestion function
5. Verify that the fix is already implemented:
   - Checks to ensure the question object exists before accessing its properties
   - Checks to ensure the answers array exists and is an array
   - Checks to ensure each answer is a valid object
   - Fallback text if the question or answer text is not available
   - Console logging for debugging purposes
6. Test the fix to ensure it works correctly
7. Document the changes made in a summary file

## Timeline
- Investigation and root cause analysis: 30 minutes
- Verification of existing fix: 15 minutes
- Documentation: 30 minutes
- Total estimated time: 1 hour 15 minutes
