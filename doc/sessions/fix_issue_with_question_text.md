# Issue Fix: "Question text will appear here" Displayed Instead of Real Question

## Problem Identification

After reviewing the code, I've identified that the placeholder text "Question text will appear here." is being displayed instead of the actual question text in the QuizMaster application.

The issue is in the frontend code:

1. In `index.html` (line 96), there's a placeholder text:
   ```html
   <h3 id="question-text">Question text will appear here.</h3>
   ```

2. The `showQuestion()` function in `script.js` (line 286-304) is responsible for updating this element with the actual question text:
   ```javascript
   function showQuestion(index) {
       const question = quizQuestions[index];
       // Update question text
       document.getElementById('question-text').textContent = question.text;
       // ...rest of the function
   }
   ```

## Solution Plan

To fix this issue, I would create a branch following the guidelines and implement the following solution:

1. Create a feature branch using the git workflow script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/git_workflow.sh --name my-name
   ```

2. Create plan and tasks markdown files in the doc/sessions/ directory as required by the guidelines.

3. Fix the issue by ensuring the question text is properly updated when a question is displayed. This could involve:
   - Verifying that the `question.text` property exists and contains the correct data
   - Ensuring the `showQuestion()` function is being called at the appropriate time
   - Adding error handling to prevent displaying placeholder text if the real question isn't available

4. Test the fix by running the application and verifying that actual questions are displayed.

5. Commit the changes and push the branch according to the workflow.

## Tasks

1. Create a feature branch using the git workflow script
2. Create plan and tasks markdown files in doc/sessions/
3. Investigate the data flow from backend to frontend for questions
4. Fix the issue in the frontend code
5. Test the application to ensure questions display correctly
6. Commit changes and push the branch

This approach follows the project guidelines while addressing the specific issue of placeholder text being displayed instead of actual questions.
