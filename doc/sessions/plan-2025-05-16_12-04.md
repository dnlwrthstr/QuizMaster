# Development Plan - 2025-05-16_12-04

## Objectives
- Fix the issue where placeholder text "Question text will appear here." is displayed instead of the actual question text
- Ensure the application handles unexpected data structures gracefully
- Add appropriate error handling and fallback text

## Implementation Steps
1. Examine the frontend code (index.html and script.js) to understand how questions are displayed
2. Investigate the data flow from backend to frontend to understand how question data is structured
3. Identify the root cause of the issue by examining the showQuestion function
4. Implement a fix to ensure the question text is properly displayed:
   - Add checks to ensure the question object exists before accessing its properties
   - Add checks to ensure the answers array exists and is an array
   - Add checks to ensure each answer is a valid object
   - Add fallback text if the question or answer text is not available
5. Document the changes made in a summary file

## Timeline
- Investigation and root cause analysis: 30 minutes
- Implementation of fix: 30 minutes
- Documentation: 15 minutes
- Total estimated time: 1 hour 15 minutes
