## Project Changes

### Latest Changes (2025-05-16_11-10)

The latest changes focus on creating scripts to run and test the FastAPI application in a virtual environment, following the requirements:
1. Create a script to run the application
2. Make required changes on a new branch
3. Follow the instructions in guidelines.md
4. Test the backend REST API

#### Changes Made

1. **Created a Script to Run the Application**
   - Created `scripts/run_app.sh`, a shell script that:
     - Activates the virtual environment (or creates one if it doesn't exist)
     - Installs dependencies if needed
     - Runs the FastAPI application
   - Made the script executable

2. **Created a Script to Test the Backend REST API**
   - Created `scripts/test_api.py`, a comprehensive test script that:
     - Tests all API endpoints (create quiz, add question, submit answer, etc.)
     - Provides colorful output for better readability
     - Can start the API if it's not already running
     - Handles errors gracefully
   - Made the script executable

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `doc/running_the_application.md` to include information about using the new run script

4. **Updated Dependencies**
   - Added the 'requests' package to requirements-dev.txt for API testing

### Previous Changes (2025-05-16_10-44)

Previous changes ensured the backend (REST API) runs on port 8091, the frontend runs on port 8090, and favicon.ico requests are properly handled.

#### Changes Made

1. **Created a Separate Frontend Server**
   - Created `frontend/server.js` to serve the frontend on port 8090
   - Added handling for favicon.ico requests (returns 204 No Content)
   - Removed frontend serving code from the backend

2. **Updated Backend Configuration**
   - Removed the root endpoint that was serving the frontend
   - Removed the static files mounting for the frontend
   - Backend now only serves API endpoints on port 8091

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated `doc/running_the_application.md` with detailed instructions on:
     - Setting up the environment (added Node.js as a prerequisite)
     - Running the backend on port 8091
     - Running the frontend on port 8090
     - Troubleshooting common issues

4. **Updated Plan and Task Files**
   - Updated `doc/sessions/plan-2025-05-16_10-44.md` with objectives and implementation steps
   - Updated `doc/sessions/tasks-2025-05-16_10-44.md` with completed tasks

### Port Configuration

- **Backend (REST API)**: Port 8091
  - Configured in `src/quizmaster/main.py`
  - No changes needed as it was already set to port 8091

- **Frontend**: 
  - Now served by a separate Node.js server on port 8090
  - API calls still correctly point to backend at port 8091

## Conclusion

This document consolidates information from all session files, providing a single reference point for development history. The original files have been archived as part of a documentation cleanup process.

All required changes have been implemented to ensure the backend runs on port 8091, the frontend runs on port 8090, and favicon.ico requests are properly handled. Comprehensive documentation has been created to help users run and test the application. The project now includes scripts to run the application and test the backend REST API.
